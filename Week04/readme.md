# Week 4 — Text in Processing & Finishing our HoL video

In this live coding session we put the words in code+words! After doing some processing tutorials in my own time, it was exciting to be able to apply the exact same principles to text.

## Second Life

Last week we had a 3 hour session to record the different scenes in Second Life we had roughly planned out. However, soon after we realised that the screen recordings were pretty terrible (frame rate wise, as well as being very out of sync with our text-to-voice generator). We were a bit tempted to keep the tacky-ness of these clips, but also felt that it was too distracting combined with the other bizarre elements we incorporated. With Second Life's eerily realistic graphics, we knew the potential for an evocative, cinematic performance was there, and were determined to grasp it.

We decided to reshoot after a few days, after more thorough planning in our shared Google doc. We had a script each and had chosen specific characters from the [text-to-voice generator](https://tetyys.com/SAPI4/) we were using for each of the characters. We planned to shoot the scenes while playing the voices in real time, so the avatars could move their mouths in sync with the script, which we would later edit over the videos.

This worked very successfully! Reshooting was a great choice, in my opinion, especially as we became well-practiced with camera controls, environment settings, and locations offered in Second Life. It also pushed us to plan meticulously, with a script and chosen locations before we began shooting.

I didn't expect it, but I felt quite challenged by this project. I'll admit that at the beginning I was rather confused about the purpose of it all. What was I meant to learn? What was it teaching me? What should I be observing?

Later on, I began to read House of Leaves. I was genuinely gripped — not only by the storyline, but by the unconventional character of the book. It was nothing like I had ever read before. As I flipped through, I sensed the liveliness of the words that begged to come off the page, that in a freshly unsettling way, stimulates the brain to understand the essence of the story. *(I also decided that I really, really needed to see it in person, and would also love to have it physically, to read the entire book...so I bought it hahaa)*

I also reflected on the electronic literature we had researched, and drew connections between those and our project. What we were creating was in fact electronic literature, though it was something I had to keep making sense of in my head. It was difficult to explain to friends or family what I was learning in studio and what this project was, and I hope that in the future I'll be able to articulate e-lit in a way that does justice to how interesting and broad it actually is.
